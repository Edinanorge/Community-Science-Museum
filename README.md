#### The brief for a project:
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself.
